Started a few weeks ago trainning the function "WHILE, DO and FOR" with VSCode software, and this exercise
presented by "Curso em Video" is able to help you learn HTML, JS, and CSS.
When you put a number on the first input, this number will be summed to the number you added on the input "Passo"
until it gets to the ending number used on the input "Fim".
Also, in this execise I used the command "img", to add an image in the center, and "favicon" to put a favorite icon
on the top of the page.
